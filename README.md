NASA-DSERL served as the learning foundation of JavaFX for this project. 
ALSO PLEASE TAKE NOTE! this was my very first "big" project in Java. does it have bugs? yes, can i fix them? 
yes, and I sure will try with time to fix them. 
But this is a learning project that I used to get the hang of MySQL and JDBC and some patterns like DAO in Java. 
I enjoyed making this very much! This is in now way a "professional grade" project and it never had that intent. 

Now without further ado let's do further!
