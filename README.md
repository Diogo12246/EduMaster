# EduMaster

EduMaster is a non professional project that I used to teach myself MySQL and JDBC, and DAO pattern in Java.

## Technology used
> MySQL
> JDBC
> Java
> JavaFX
> Maven

## Notes to you dear reader!

Does it have bugs? yes
Can you fix them? yes
Will you fix them? yes, with time.

Please understand this was my very first "big" project in Java!
I used it like i stated before for learning purposes.
I had a ton of fun doing it, but i recognize some flaws in it and
there is room for improvement.

I also note some good features on it and how they might be useful
for someone that wishes to read the code and learn a bit of JavaFX

Thank you for reading!
Have a wonderful day!
